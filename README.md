dump: wrote maskfile.txt

*Automagically building pdf with travis-ci using [dfm's guide](http://dfm.io/posts/travis-latex/).*

* WHY do users need to create their own products? (RB, asteroids, variable apertures, crowding etcetc).
* WHAT are we providing? (lightkurve, easy Kepler/K2/TESS access).
* HOW can they use it? (Beautiful examples).

## Plots required:
* TPF and masking [DONE]
* flattening?
* motion detrending
* CBV correction
* planet finding

## Current tasks

* Christina: Generate plots with new code/new styles
* Christina: Recovering a planet section
* Gully: "What tools are currently available"
* Geert: Introduction/Background on Kepler
* AMC: PSF Photometry. (This section is currently maths and no motivation.)
